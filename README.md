Currently working on a rewrite: [v2_intel_8086_disassembler](https://github.com/Stef-van-Stipdonk/v2_intel_8086_disassembler)  
The code became too unwieldy.

Written as part of the homework for the Performance-Aware Programming Series.

To test listing 37, 38, 39, 41, run the test_file.sh bash script.  
To test listing 43, 44, compile the main.c file, then run the executable with argument "-e" to simulate execution, also pass in the path to the file to simulate.  
Pipe the output into a file, then compare it to the corrisponding file in the manual_check_files directory.
